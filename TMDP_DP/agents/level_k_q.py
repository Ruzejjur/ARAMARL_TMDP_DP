    """
    A Level-K Q-learning agent for multi-agent environments.

    This agent uses a cognitive hierarchy model. It reasons about the opponent's
    actions to make better decisions. The Q-function is three-dimensional,
    representing the value of a state-action pair, conditioned on the
    opponent's intended action: `Q(s, a_self, a_opponent)`.

    - k=1 (Base Case): A Level-1 agent models its opponent as Level-0 (random).
      It uses a Dirichlet distribution to learn the opponent's policy `P(b|s)`
      from observed actions.
    - k>1 (Recursive Step): A Level-k agent models its opponent as a
      Level-(k-1) agent. It recursively builds this model to predict the
      opponent's policy.

    Attributes:
        k (int): The cognitive level of the agent. A Level-k agent models its
                 opponent as a Level-(k-1) agent.
        n_states (int): The total number of states in the environment.
        learning_rate (float): The learning rate (alpha) for Q-function updates.
        epsilon (float): The exploration rate for the epsilon-greedy policy.
        gamma (float): The discount factor for future rewards.
        action_space (np.ndarray): The set of actions available to this agent.
        opponent_action_space (np.ndarray): The set of actions available to the opponent.
        lower_level_k_epsilon(float): The exploration rate embeded into lower levels of the k-level hierarchy.
        grid_size (int): The size of one dimension of the square grid.
        Q (np.ndarray): The agent's Q-table, with shape
                        (n_states, num_self_actions, num_opponent_actions).
        opponent (LevelKQAgent): The agent's internal model of its opponent.
                                 This is None for a Level-1 agent.
        dirichlet_counts (np.ndarray): Dirichlet counts for modeling a Level-0
                                       opponent's policy. Used only by Level-1 agents.
